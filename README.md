# Algorithms Exercise

This was a quick afternoon project to train the implementation of some algoritms with python.

It includes:
  - Two palindromes checkers (an iterative one and a recursive one);
  - A brute force searcher (`/challenges/challenge_study_schedule.py`);
  - A quick sorter anagram checker (`/challenges/challenge_anagrams.py`);
  - A duplicate checker (`/challenges/challenge_find_the_duplicate.py`).

I've also developed unit tests to the file in `/challenges/challenge_encrypt_message.py`)

## Installation

If you want to run any of the algorithms, just run the following commands on the project's root to initialize the local environment and then to install its dependencies:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```
